# ESP32 IR-Server
> Control your MT-VIKI HDMI Switch through HTTP

## Gist
This repository provides the code for an ESP32 with an appripriate IR transmitter to be used as an alternative remote
for this particular HDMI switch: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0881SF6ZK

This primarily resulted from me wanting to hide the switch and control it with my iPhone.

You could also extend it further for HomeAssistant support.
