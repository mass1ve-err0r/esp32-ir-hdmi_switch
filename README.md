# ESP32 IR-Server
> Control your MT-VIKI HDMI Switch through HTTP

## Outline
This repository provides the code for an ESP32 with an appripriate IR transmitter to be used as an alternative remote
for the HDMI switch.

This primarily resulted from me wanting to hide the switch and control it with my iPhone.

You could also extend it further for HomeAssistant support.
